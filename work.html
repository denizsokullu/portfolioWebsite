            <h1>Algorithms with a Purpose Coding Competition</h1>
            <p>
              Hosted every year, Algorithms with a Purpose(AWAP), is a student run competition where teams are given a certain amount of time to come up with an algorithm that handles real life issues of Computer Science.This year, I was selected for the executive board, and designed the whole system of the competition, starting from the websites from which the tournament is run, web applications and t-shirt designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used a Django framework to build a dynamic website with team login, submission collection and algorithm replay animation.

              The event will be held in February 2017 so I will update content as the project reaches an end.

            <h1>Paint the Pavement</h1>
            <p>
              For our Communication Design Studio, we were given the task of creating a application package/system that would encourage communities to apply to "Paint the Pavement Pittsburgh" in which the community gathers together and paints certain pavements in the intersection with colorful artworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were given a large amount information to place into the package and I designed this package which would be given to school teachers and PTAs to encourage them to make an event where they can paint the pavement with their children and make their community come together.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application package includes regulations and rules, a calendar of due dates, general application information, and the application forms that will be filled out.

            <h1>Sophomore Summer Internship</h1>
            <p>
              I spent my sophomore summer working at a company called Egegen Internet Solutions in Istanbul, Turkey. The company focused on quickly building robust and simple websites according to the customers needs.
              I was working with the Web Designers and Web Developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on creating grids for websites and connecting data and links with the PHP backend of the system. I heavily used HTML/CSS to bring the designs alive and present them to the customers and had a chance to have a large impact on several websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that I loved working with the web environment and I think this summer helped me understand the underlying principles and tools that I need to know to become a good Web Designer/Web Developer.

            <h1>Designer History Book </h1>
              <p>
                One of the projects I did this year was about making a Designer's Biography Book and a set of websites. Every student picked a designer(I picked Erik Nitsche) and we worked on exploring and studying their life, understanding how their work relates to their life and finding ways to reflect their style and voice with our spreads and websites(but still being careful with imitating). 
              </p>
              <p> 
                We first worked on gathering information, reading books and articles about our designers. After that we gathered all the information needed, we started grouping the information into logical blocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the information collection was done, we worked on developing our own type guide and grids to fit our text into the spreads. Things we paid attention to: Rivers, Flow of the Page, Eligible Text, White Space(aka breathing space), Navigation, breaking the text into chunks.

            <p>
              One of the term projects I did last semester included a game! I was always interested in tower defense games(bloons td, master of defense, warcraft 3 mods, orcs and trolls, canyon defense, etc.) and I thought this was my chance to make a game that I would enjoy. The class was teaching fundamentals of programming using Python so I used Python, Pygame and NetworkX to make this game. There was some graph theory to tackle but it was enjoyable as I got to create my own artwork for the game as well! I ended using Revenge on Titans enemy sprites as they were amazing and I always wanted  to use them. Except those, the maps, the towers, interfaces and the starting screen was all made using Photoshop and Illustrator. The game took 3 weeks to complete and I can say that it was the most fun 3 weeks of my college life until now. Enjoy!

During this mission, the lander, which will remain on the moon indefinitely, will house a non-encyclopedic view of humanity and life on earth – the Moon Arts Ark – intended to be a Cultural Heritage Site.

                In this project, our instructor Mark Baskinger picked me and several classmates to illustrate the inhabitants of Earth on one of the disks that would go inside the capsule designed above.(The whole thing would be several capsules). I was given the task to illustrate the some of the inhabitants of the Arctic Sea,  and was amazed to sea the intricate nature of the Arctic Sea.

              <p>Studio project where we were assigned a material, in our case colored pencils, and were asked to create a typeface/alphabet out of the material we had.  It was a challenge in many ways (getting more pencils everyday) yet we had a good amount of time to experiement with our material. I did not know I could use pencils like this, but now I know that make are perfect for making typefaces.</p>
              <p>Each letter was made out of pencil shavings that we carefully bent into shape and naturally photographed to create the 26 letter typeface. Challenges that have been faced: Pencils not shaving correctly, shaving that were too fragile, and breaking pencil tips.</p>
