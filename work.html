            <h1>Designer History Book </h1>
              <p>
                One of the projects I did this year was about making a Designer's Biography Book and a set of websites. Every student picked a designer(I picked Erik Nitsche) and we worked on exploring and studying their life, understanding how their work relates to their life and finding ways to reflect their style and voice with our spreads and websites(but still being careful with imitating). 
              </p>
              <p> 
                We first worked on gathering information, reading books and articles about our designers. After that we gathered all the information needed, we started grouping the information into logical blocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the information collection was done, we worked on developing our own type guide and grids to fit our text into the spreads. Things we paid attention to: Rivers, Flow of the Page, Eligible Text, White Space(aka breathing space), Navigation, breaking the text into chunks.

            <h1>Tutsian Defenders</h1>
            <p>
              One of the term projects I did last semester included a game! I was always interested in tower defense games(bloons td, master of defense, warcraft 3 mods, orcs and trolls, canyon defense, etc.) and I thought this was my chance to make a game that I would enjoy. The class was teaching fundamentals of programming using Python so I used Python, Pygame and NetworkX to make this game. There was some graph theory to tackle but it was enjoyable as I got to create my own artwork for the game as well! I ended using Revenge on Titans enemy sprites as they were amazing and I always wanted  to use them. Except those, the maps, the towers, interfaces and the starting screen was all made using Photoshop and Illustrator. The game took 3 weeks to complete and I can say that it was the most fun 3 weeks of my college life until now. Enjoy!

              <p>
                ​In 2016, Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotic Institute will send a rover to the Moon in competition for the Google Lunar X Prize. During this mission, the lander, which will remain on the moon indefinitely, will house a non-encyclopedic view of humanity and life on earth – the Moon Arts Ark – intended to be a Cultural Heritage Site.

                In this project, our instructor Mark Baskinger picked me and several classmates to illustrate the inhabitants of Earth on one of the disks that would go inside the capsule designed above.(The whole thing would be several capsules). I was given the task to illustrate the some of the inhabitants of the Arctic Sea,  and was amazed to sea the intricate nature of the Arctic Sea.

            <h1>Close Shave</h1>
            <p>Studio project where we were assigned a material, in our case colored pencils, and were asked to create a typeface/alphabet out of the material we had.  It was a challenge in many ways (getting more pencils everyday) yet we had a good amount of time to experiement with our material. I did not know I could use pencils like this, but now I know that make are perfect for making typefaces.</p>
            <p>Each letter was made out of pencil shavings that we carefully bent into shape and naturally photographed to create the 26 letter typeface. Challenges that have been faced: Pencils not shaving correctly, shaving that were too fragile, and breaking pencil tips.</p>
